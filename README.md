<h1 align="center">3D Tour</h1>
<div align="center">
This is a 3d tour project that I made. My parents needed to use a 3D tour of our house, but all the online sites are paied/have restrictions. So I made one myself!

Thanks to github for the free domain (3dtour.github.io) :D.

I made the site using https://www.marzipano.net/ Not a really good choice, if you exported your project and wan't to add more, you need to add the stuff by hand.
